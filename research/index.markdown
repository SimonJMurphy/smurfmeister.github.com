Work
====

As a member of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, and chair of the time-series analysis sub-group of the classical pulsators working group, I use ultra-precise Kepler data to study the A-type stars. In addition to publicly available software, I perform data analysis with my own suite of tools designed specifically for working with Kepler data.

As well as providing a rough description of what it is I do, this page serves as a useful place to collect all of my research material in one place, so that prospective employers find it easier to give me a job (nudge nudge). In fact, that is why I've uploaded my [CV](/images/CV_SJM.pdf), too.

Current Research
================
* Finding binaries among pulsating stars;
* Chemically peculiar stars in and around the delta Scuti instability strip;
* Developing the MK process for spectral classification;
* Case studies of individual delta Scuti stars; and
* Extending the number of known &lambda; Bootis stars.

You may also like to take a look at the video of a [public talk](http://vimeo.com/68289086) I gave in May 2013, or this short (300-word) [research summary](/images/research_summary.pdf).
