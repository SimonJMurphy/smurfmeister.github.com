Work
========

As a member of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium I use ultra-precise Kepler data to study the A-type stars. In addition to publicly available software, I perform data analysis with my own suite of tools designed specifically for working with Kepler data.

As well as providing a rough description of what it is I do, this page serves as a useful place to collect all of my research material in one place, so that prospective employers find it easier to give me a job (nudge nudge). In fact, that is why I've uploaded my [CV](/images/CV_SJM.pdf), too.

* Investigating the chemically peculiar stars in the delta Scuti instability strip; and
* Case studies of individual delta Scuti stars.
