Work
====

I recently wrote some MCMC software from scratch for analysing the orbits of binary stars. The observational data are extracted from Kepler photometry, by quantifying phase shifts in stellar pulsations. I also investigate the interior rotation rates of stars using the same photometry, by looking for periodic patterns in the g mode pulsations of &gamma; Doradus stars. Rotational splittings in the oscillation frequencies reveal the rotation rate of the stellar core. Repeating this analysis for a large number of stars allows the angular momentum profiles of intermediate-mass stars to be mapped across a variety of stellar properties.

Current Research
================
* Finding binaries among pulsating stars;
* Mapping the internal rotation profiles of main-sequence stars;
* Developing methods for super-Nyquist asteroseismology
- Chemically peculiar stars in and around the delta Scuti instability strip;
- Developing the MK process for spectral classification;
- Extending the number of known &lambda; Bootis stars.
