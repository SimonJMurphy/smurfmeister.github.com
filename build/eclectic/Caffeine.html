        <h1 id='caffeine_addiction'>Caffeine Addiction</h1>

<p>It is common knowledge among my friends that I have a slight addiction to Red Bull (or equivalent energy drink). I have it under control &#8211; only one per day, and only on work days. I enjoy it and I consider it a daily treat. You may have your own. It is an addiction that carries with it a certain stigma. I notice, however, that coffee does not have the same stigma, and I&#8217;m even shunned for <em>not</em> drinking coffee. So I took it upon myself to compare habits.</p>
<img height='300' src='/images/caffeine_plot.png' width='600' />
<h2 id='the_plot'>The plot</h2>

<p>The above is a plot showing the caffeine level in the body as a function of time, based on two models (explained below in &#8216;The study&#8217;). The coffee+choc model obviously has much higher intake, but the caffeine is not completely metabolised before the next day when the 10:30 coffee is taken. This is why I had to extend the plot to cover saturday.</p>

<p>Just for fun, I also decided to plot the altitude of the Sun, calculated for latitude 40&#176; N (Porto &#8211; my city of residence at the time of writing), and the current week (12-17th Nov inclusive)&#8230; Sadly, it reaches a lower altitude each day. It serves as a useful reference point for when each day starts and ends.</p>

<h2 id='the_study'>The study</h2>

<p>I decided to study the caffeine level in the body of (a) a Red Bull addict who has, in this scenario, one can of Red Bull (or substitute) once per day. It was chosen in the scenario to combat the post-lunch dip, delivering 80mg of caffeine at 1pm. This is the same amount of caffeine as a 150ml cup of brewed coffee (though <a href='http://www.coffee.org/articles/index.php?art=182'>strengths do vary somewhat</a>). I call this the Red Bull model of caffeine intake. Scenario (b) is the coffee addict. My coffee addict has three cups of coffee, 150mg caffeine per cup, at 10:30, 11:00 and 14:30. My coffee addict also likes a bit of chocolate in the evenings, consuming 70mg of caffeine in the process, at 20:00. This is the coffee-choc model. 150mg caffeine per cup is a bit high, but astronomers seem to <a href='http://io9.com/5948206/here-are-the-fifteen-professions-that-drink-the-most-coffee-guess-whos-number-one'>drink more / stronger coffee</a> than other professions.</p>

<h2 id='the_mathematics'>The mathematics</h2>

<p>From a <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11839447'>study</a> of rate of absorption in caffeinated gum vs. caffeine capsules, which shows a peak caffeine level after 44.2&#8211;80.4 min for gum vs. 84.0&#8211;120.0 for capsules, I assumed that total caffeine absorption occurs after 90 minutes of ingestion (i.e. with a 100% absorption efficiency), with a linear absorption rate between the time of ingestion and the 90-minute limit. Metabolism (with half-life 4.9 hours) begins 0.1 hours after ingestion. Caffeine intoxication - the point where a person begins to feel seriously messed up with jitters etc. - occurs at around 300 mg.</p>

<h2 id='the_conclusions'>The conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>My Red Bull habit is pretty mild.</li>

<li>Perhaps some money could be made in converting this into an app, where users log their caffeine intake. Could use Starbucks as a sponsor for some advertising revenue :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ironically, I did this work whilst not under the influence of Red Bull. Put it down to withdrawal symptoms.</p>
