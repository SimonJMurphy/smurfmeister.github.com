<h2 id='outline'>Outline</h2>

<p>After a couple of long bicycle rides in the same week on a rather nice bike in Majorca, I decided that, since I&#8217;m not a bad runner, it might be worth having a go at a triathlon. The fact that I go swimming barely once a year and sink like a brick was a minor footnote on the decision, so, as always, I jumped head-on into my new &#8216;grand idea&#8217; without any real training. Here&#8217;s what happened.</p>

<div class='section'>
<h1 id='testing_the_water'>Testing the water</h1>

<p>I decided I ought to go for a practice swim a few days before I planned to do the triathlon. The pool was closed, so I went for a run instead. That covers the entirety of the swimming training, and the 10 km run was my first (and only) one before the full triathlon, with a final time of 44:50.</p>
</div>

<div class='section'>
<h1 id='the_main_event_4th_sept_2012'>The main event, 4th Sept. 2012</h1>

<p>The triathlon (olympic distance) features a 1.5 km swim, a 40 km cycle and 10 km run.</p>

<h2 id='swim'>Swim</h2>

<p>I got to the pool bright and early (for me anyway), ready to swim at 9am. Unfortunately, the pool manager is an idiot and decided to revert back to &#8216;term time schedule&#8217; from &#8216;holiday schedule&#8217;, even though kids weren&#8217;t all back at school. Only swim schools had access to the pool for the next three hours, and I don&#8217;t think they had a single user. Idiots.</p>

<p>I went back at 12 noon, highly caffeinated and twitching with excitement. I nailed the swim (breast stroke) in 39 minutes, which is probably a personal best, in the way that the first time you properly time yourself doing something always is.</p>

<h2 id='poor_transition'>Poor transition</h2>

<p>The actual transition time from pool to being ready for the next component was 8 minutes, which itself is slow, but I then had to drive from Bourne to Morton (3 miles) to pick up the bike I was doing the cycling component on. As such, this transition ended up being 19 minutes! Ouch!</p>

<h2 id='cycle'>Cycle</h2>

<p>The <a href='http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/132324821'>cycling route</a> can be found on my mapmyrun.com page (username smurfmeister) and was chosen to be very flat. I didn&#8217;t check road smoothness beforehand, so I got pot-luck with that, and aside from short sections of loose chippings it wasn&#8217;t too bad. Being mostly open fen roads, I did suffer some headwind, which although its a circular route, isn&#8217;t quite made up for by tailwind (for mathematical reasons&#8230; feel free to ask!). The total time for the 40-km ride was 1h29min, thus averaging 27 km/h (approx. 17 mph). I am indebted to Jonny Palmer for lending me his road bike; thanks Jonny!</p>

<h2 id='run'>Run</h2>

<p>The run was a simple out-and-back, again on <a href='http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/132322045'>flat fen roads</a> (my trial on slightly hilly routes left my dodgy knees in pain, so I scrapped that route). My transition from the bicycle to the running only involved a quick pit-stop and locking the bike up, taking just a couple of minutes. The run began after exactly 2h30m. Five minutes later the Sun came out and I wasn&#8217;t getting much cooling off the breeze. The final 5 km were agonising, and I was severely dehydrated. Total run time was 49:24, only five minutes slower than the trial run, which was done fresh!</p>
<strong>Total time: 3:19:24</strong></div>
