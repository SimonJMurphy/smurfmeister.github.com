ec.lec.tic
========
    (n) a person who derives ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources
    (adj) selecting what seems best from various styles, doctrines, ideas, methods, etc.

I have been described as <q>a few sigma away from normal</q>, but I like it that way. I have a tendency to over-analyse everything, but occasionally this produces rare gems of insight and understanding of the world around us. These analyses most often take from everyday life, such as the [distribution of running times](Running-times) of my dvd collection, the [caffeine levels](Caffeine) of coffee-addicted astronomers, or the pattern of wear and erosion of steps inside a church.

Recognising the potential danger of being pigeon-holed as someone who desperately needs to get out more, I like to point out that I push myself to physical limits from time to time, too. An example is the [olympic triathlon](Triathlon) I decided to do for fun, or [sliding down a glacier](http://the-smurfmeister.tumblr.com/andrews-glacier) in Rocky Mountain National Park, wearing shorts.
