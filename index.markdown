Welcome
=======

Iâ€™m Simon Murphy, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney. I use data from the Kepler Space Telescope to investigate A-type stars using a technique called asteroseismology. I also conduct spectral classification of A-type stars, with a keen interest in Am and &lambda; Boo peculiarities.

Research
========

Ongoing projects include:

* Finding binaries among pulsating stars;
* Mapping the internal rotation profiles of main-sequence stars;
* Developing methods for super-Nyquist asteroseismology

My publications are collected under the [Research](/research) tab on the top-right of the page.

Hobbies
=======

Everyone needs a good hobby, or several. I enjoy many of the usual hobbies of males in their mid-twenties, with a propensity towards those with greater chances of causing injury (apparently!): climbing, cycling, snowboarding, hiking, football and running; but also playing board games, and watching films. For a better insight into the functioning of my mind and the stuff I get up to, you may like to visit the [Eclectic section](/eclectic) of my website :-)
