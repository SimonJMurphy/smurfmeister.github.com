Welcome
=======

Iâ€™m Simon Murphy, and I am a PhD student working with Prof. Don Kurtz at the Jeremiah Horrocks Institute at the University of Central Lancashire. I use data from the Kepler Space Telescope to investigate A-type stars using a technique called asteroseismology.

Ongoing projects include:

* Investigating the chemically peculiar stars in the delta Scuti instability strip;
* Case studies of individual delta Scuti stars; and
* Extending the number of known lambda Bootis stars.

Hobbies
=======

Everyone needs a good hobby, or several. I enjoy many of the usual hobbies of males in their mid-twenties, with a propensity towards those with greater chances of causing injury (apparently!): climbing, cycling, snowboarding, hiking, football and running; but also board games, computer games and films. For a better insight into the functioning of my mind and the stuff I get up to, you may like to visit the [Eclectic section](/eclectic) of my website :-)
