Welcome
=======

Iâ€™m Simon Murphy, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney. I use data from the Kepler Space Telescope to investigate A-type stars using a technique called asteroseismology. I also conduct spectral classification of A-type stars, with a keen interest in Am and &lambda; Boo peculiarities.

Research
========

Ongoing projects include:

* Investigating the chemically peculiar stars in and around the delta Scuti instability strip;
* Developing the MK process for spectral classification;
* Case studies of individual delta Scuti stars; and
* Extending the number of known &lambda; Bootis stars.

Hobbies
=======

Everyone needs a good hobby, or several. I enjoy many of the usual hobbies of males in their mid-twenties, with a propensity towards those with greater chances of causing injury (apparently!): climbing, cycling, snowboarding, hiking, football and running; but also playing board games, and watching films. For a better insight into the functioning of my mind and the stuff I get up to, you may like to visit the [Eclectic section](/eclectic) of my website :-)
